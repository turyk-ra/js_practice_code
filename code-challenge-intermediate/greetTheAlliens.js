// 1.
// Write a function, greetAliens(), that takes in an array of strings and uses a for loop to print a greeting with each string in the array.

// The greeting should take the following format:
// “Oh powerful [stringElement], we humans offer our unconditional surrender!”
// Note: You may have noticed how convenient it would be to use .forEach(), but you’re not allowed to use it here. ]

// Write your code here:
const greetAliens = array => {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        console.log(`Oh powerful ${array[i]}, we humans offer our unconditional surrender!`);
    }
}

// When you're ready to test your code, uncomment the below and run:

const aliens = ["Blorgous", "Glamyx", "Wegord", "SpaceKing"];

console.log(greetAliens(aliens));
