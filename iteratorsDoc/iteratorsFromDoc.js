// 1.
// In the code editor, there is an array called words. We want to create a new array of interesting words. The first thing we want to do is check if there are words that are меньше than 6 characters long. There is something missing in the words.some() method call. Fix this method so that true is printed to the console.

// For more information browse MDN’s documentation on .some() .

// Checkpoint 2 Passed
// 2.
// The .some() method returned true, which means there are some words in the array that are shorter than six characters. Use the .filter() method to save any words longer than 5 characters to a new variable called interestingWords, declared with const.

// We’ve used .filter() in a previous exercise, but, for more information browse MDN’s documentation on .filter() .

// Checkpoint 3 Passed
// 3.
// In the last line of main.js, there is this code:

// // console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>        ));

// Complete the code between the parentheses to check if every element has more than 5 characters.

// Make sure to uncomment (delete the // before) the last line of the program before you run the code.

// For more information browse MDN’s documentation on .every()

const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some((word) => {
    return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter(word => {
    return word.length > 5;
})

console.log(interestingWords);
// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => {
    return word.length > 5;
}));
