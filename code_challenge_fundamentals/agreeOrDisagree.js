// Write your function here:
const agreeOrDisagree = (string1, string2) => string1 === string2 ? 'You agree!' : 'You disagree!';
// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep")) // Should print 'You agree!'
// We encourage you to add more function call of your own to test your code!
console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "Yep"));
console.log(agreeOrDisagree(1, 1));
console.log(agreeOrDisagree(10, 1));
